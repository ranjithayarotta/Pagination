# Pagination
Initially the list page will show only 10 books. As the user scrolls to reach the end of page, the next set of 10 books will be automatically fetched and displayed in page. This process will continue till all books in the database are displayed. When the user clicks on a book title or image in the list, the user can be navigated to another screen to display more details about the book. The navigation will happen with SPA(single-page-application) and should not navigate to another url in browser. Please ensure all UI rendering is happening on the client-side using AJAX calls
